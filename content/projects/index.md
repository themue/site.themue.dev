### Go Modules

- [Go Audit](https://pkg.go.dev/mod/tideland.dev/go/audit) for testing and test data generation
- [Go Actor](https://pkg.go.dev/mod/tideland.dev/go/actor) for simple goroutine development

> NOTE
>
> There is some more stuff in the [Tideland repositories](https://github.com/tideland), just
> take a look. It's group in larger repositories and so sadly hard to find. So I'll now step
> by step split these repositories into individual smaller projects.

### Applications

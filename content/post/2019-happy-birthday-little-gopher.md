Today we're celebrating the birthday of our little gopher. Googles programming language Go turns 10 today. A decode of growing and getting better every year without breaking the promise of source code compatibility. The community grew to about two million developers world wide and many projects of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation are using Go for implementation. My career since 2011 in the areas of cloud provisioning, logistic micro-services, ethereum, and Kubernetes mostly is using Go, a good feeling.

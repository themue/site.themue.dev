Today we're celebrating the birthday of our little gopher, Googles programming language Go turns 10. A decade of growing and getting better every year without breaking the promise of source code compatibility. So the community grew to about two million developers world wide and we can find a pretty large number of projects developed in Go. Especially many projects of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation are using Go for implementation, like Docker and Kubernetes, Etcd and Prometheus.

When Go started in 2009 I immediately started to experiment with it too. I used Erlang/OTP before, because its ideas of concurrency interested me. So it has been quite natural that Googles language sounded exciting. Talks, articles, and a book followed, since 2011 I'm using Go professionally. Cloud provisioning, a logistics application based on micro-services, Ethereum, und Kubernetes, the language always has been a good companion.

For German readers I wrote a little news about the last decade for the [Heise Developer](https://www.heise.de/developer/meldung/Programmiersprache-Go-feiert-zehnten-Geburtstag-4583503.html).

Happy birthday, little Gopher!

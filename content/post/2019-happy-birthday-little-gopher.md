Today we're celebrating the birthday of our little gopher. Googles programming language Go turns 10 today. A decade of growing and getting better every year without breaking the promise of source code compatibility. The community grew to about two million developers world wide and many projects of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation are using Go for implementation. 

I learned Go in 2009 to, coming from Erlang/OTP. Reason has been my interest in concurrent languages. After according articles and a book about Go in 2011 my career covers the areas of cloud provisioning, logistical micro-services, Ethereum, and Kubernetes mostly by using Go. It always has been a good feeling.

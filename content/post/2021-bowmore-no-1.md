I didn't have the **Bowmore No. 1** in a big bottle, but only as a small 50 ml addition to the **Bowmore 12 yo**. A good size for tasting unknown drops. So is this simple malt, matured only in first fill bourbon casks.

### Nose

The Bowmore surprises with its very light aroma for an Islay. It is almost sweet, with notes of vanilla. There is also a damp, slightly earthy spring meadow.  The small amount of smoke surprised me.

### Taste

This is where the Bowmore turns back into an Islay after all, with strong smoke and spice coating the tongue. There's also oak, nuts and nice dark orange-chocolate.

### Finish

Here the malt has a warm and smooth but lingering finish. The sweetness of the nose comes back and is accompanied by citrus notes.

Overall, Bowmore No. 1 is a smooth and not very spectacular single malt. It is okay, but nothing more. Bowmore has better drops on offer here.

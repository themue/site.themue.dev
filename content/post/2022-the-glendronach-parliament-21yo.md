A drop that had to wait almost three years for me to open it. But now there was an event that I wanted to reward myself for. So I looked for my **The GlenDronach Parliament 21yo** from my stash and allowed this old Highland speciality with 48% to find its way into my nosing glass.

### Nose

A really nice and intense blend, of plums and sultanas, of light walnut notes, violets and spices. They caress the nose. Later, the scent reminds of Christmas pastries.

### Taste

The taste of GelnDronach is wonderfully intense and round. The sherry is found again, as are the plums and the walnuts. There are also tones of bitter chocolate, a little orange and cinnamon. This is more fun with every sip.

### Finish

The finish is just as beautiful as the taste. It lasts a long time and is already warm. At the same time, it leaves a tasty spiciness in the mouth.

With its 21 years, Parliament is not a drop for every day, but for nice occasions. It achieved **94/100** points on my scale.

In January 21 to 23, 2020 are the next [GoDays](https://www.godays.io) in Berlin, Germany. And I hope it will be a great conference for all Gophers again like it has been this year too.

While being a passive visitor last time I'll be active with two slots this time:

First one will be a workshop from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on 21st together with Nico Schieder and Indradhanush Gupta. We'll introduce you in *Kubernetes* as platform for own components, because it can do more than deploy and manage containers. And we'll show you how to develop these Kubernetes Operators.

And second one will be a talk from 11:00 am to 11:35 am on 23rd about having *fun with functions* in Go. The language provides multiple paradigms in a wonderful pragmatic way. And thankfully Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson gave functions the right meaning. They are powerful, they are elegant, and they provide fun.

I hope we'll see there and you enjoy the whole conference and especially my slots.

**And not only motivated by a virus.**

Interestingly I wanted to write about this topic since a longer time. Since 2011 I'm now doing remote work, only once interrupted. And that interruption has been together with two hours of commuting each day, loosing time and money. This already is a good motivation for working from home. But so far it only has been a benefit by having employers which are organized as distributed remote working companies. Now the situation changed, a virus forces people to work from home as well as companies quickly have to change their processes and infrastructures.

There are several benefits beside lower costs and loosing less time. So for example the teams are virtual and spread over many locations. You may think it's negative, but so teams depend on their knowledge and interest for a topic and not on their location. It also helps when being handicapped or when you've got a young family. Another fascinating aspect when your company and the team are spread over the world is the varied mixture of colleagues from many different continents and countries. It's a great feeling.

Surely there are several challenges. As a company you have to ensure access to your internal infrastructure, for example using a VPN. Or you use an infrastructure provided by several service providers like Google or Microsoft. And there are many more solutions allowing 100% remote companies to do without own server and software installations. They cover mail and calendar, office suite, chat, video conference, all around software development, sales, HR, travel agencies and cost management, and many services more. It's fantastic.

Beside technology there are also process aspects to handle. The communication is different from just move to the next office. So establish chat rooms and messaging. And meetings should be only short via video conferences. You need to find a common language, often English, if your teams are spread over several countries. Next level is the spreading over different time zones. It's not always simple to keep individual groups close to each other to make their work more simple. Also coordinating appointments needs precise times together with time zones or UTC to have it fixed for all. And in software development you also need to establish distributed review processes ensuring that only approved and tested branches get merged into the code base (which also is good for local development).

So far a quick overview over business aspects. But there are also many individual ones. It starts with your regular morning. This best should be like for a regular office job. You get up in the morning, go into the bath, get dressed, have your breakfast, and start your work. This in detail surely depends on your personal preferences, you've got a lot of freedom. But the regularity helps you to switch into a work mode, separating between spare time and work. And it helps you to focus. Last but not least your colleagues know when they can reach you best.

There are also many ways to arrange your work area. It helps a lot if you can chose a quiet area for the most time of your daily work, optimal surely an own room, a home office. But it also works with a different quiet room. Sleeping rooms are quiet over the day too, or a dressing room. If nobody is at home over the day the kitchen table may be okay too, or a litte desk in your living room. And when the virus crises is over again a co-working space is a very good alternative too. Here they provide a good infrastructure and you good other people for daily smalltalk around you.

While I mentioned best find a standard time and location this doesn't mean it's fixed. Modern working from home means that it's normally no problem to move or interrupt your working times due to visits of doctors, garages, barbers, quickly shop a bargain, or simply having a break to enjoy the sun. If possible you could work on your veranda too. And it's always nice to meet colleagues in a coffee shop to discuss topics or simply cultivate your contacts once it's possible again.

Working from home should not lead to isolation, use your possibilities to contact the colleagues and talk about topics not related to your work. It's like standing with a cup of coffee in the door of the next office room and talk to your colleagues about movies, music, or hobbies. Only that it's virtually. Instant messaging, text chats, and video calls help a lot. Only take care how you're writing in chat. Your colleagues don't get your facial expression or your voice. Once a conversation gets unpleasant ask for a quick video call, it helps. Also typical team meetings, daily or weekly, should be via video. No long time, just exchanging news or the current status of a process. This helps a lot.

All meeting protocols and other documentation should be maintained online too. Here you can use tools like the Google docs or a wiki. This way the information reaches all people of your team, regardless of location or individual reasons for missing a meeting.

While working our cat often sleeps in my office. And from time to time she likes to jump on my lap or the desk, especially when I've got a video call. But that's never a problem, nobody cares. Also when your partner or your child rushes into the room. Quickly excuse yourself, mute the microphone, care for the interruption, and return to the meeting. Remote working people normally are pretty flexible here too.

So only one part left, especially when the virus crisis is over and we can travel again. Remote companies should establish real life meetings from time to time. Those may be in smaller teams or with the whole company if possible. Even in pure remote companies it is very important to create a better team spirit. This is hard to establish via video. In real life people meet from face to face, talk about much more than only work, have fun, enjoy good meals, and drink wine or beer. Events together like sightseeing tours can amplify this.

Interestingly I already wanted to write about remote work before the current crisis. I had the luck to start with it in 2011. I then began working for [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), a world-wide distributed company. My direct colleagues had been spread from New Zealand and Australia via several locations in Europe to North- and South-America. A fantastic feeling. Actually I'm working for [Loodse](https://www.loodse.com/), not as large but 100% remote too. And I enjoy working with all my different colleagues.

But right now the motivation for many is a different one. It's the virus crisis which forces people to stay home and to work there. Not all jobs allow to do so, but IT jobs like mine or many other typical office jobs do so. So this possibly is a chance to establish remote work even more. So far many executive boards are still sceptical.

Why do I appreciate remote work so much? It's being close to the family, having a self designed office, quiet and in my case with self-chosen hardware. Additionally I'm avoiding the daily commuting. Here I once had an one hour distance, 10 hours lost time per week, not talking about the additional cost. So useless and dumb. And I also like the freedom regarding the time or the working place, will write more about it later. And a special benefit is the feeling. Your team isn't determined by the location. It's determined by the specialisation of the people, their knowledge, their interests. And as mentioned above you may have international colleagues you're working with each day.

### Infrastructure

One interesting topic is the infrastructure. Many companies do have their own data center. So they need enough capacity and the technology to enter it from outside. VPNs and terminal servers are a way. The other one chosen by many IT startups is to use external services like Google Apps. And there's a lot for office, HR and recruiting, sales, customer service, travel booking and cost management, documentation, and communication. And for development teams there's code management, code review, and CI. So you can avoid own central infrastructure.

But still the employees need their hardware. Distribution of central managed computers and mobile phones is one way. Another is supporting people in buying their own computer or using their private ones for the job too. As we all know we have individual preferences. As long as those match to the environment it's no problem.

### Processes

Surely communication is more simple when sitting in one room or you just have to walk around the corner. But there are possibilities. You can establish instant messaging, group chats in channels, or video calls. In case of being spread over multiple countries and time zones you have to take care when setting up meetings. Try to find a convenient time vor all invited colleagues, communicate times including a fixed time zone like UTC, and take care for bank holidays. Sounds difficult but isn't. Just care for it.

Also when having your video group calls, single ones as well as regular ones per day or week, then try to make them short. It's difficult to participate in long video discussions, especially when you're one of the passive members for one topic. So try to first cover the status exchange for all or general discussions and then setup individual calls for smaller groups with need for more discussion.

Another aspect of distribution is the sharing of information. Not all can always exchange in the meetings and calls, follow all chats, or participate in detailed discussions about decisions. So always take notes and document ideas, concepts, and decisions. Here wikis are very simple and useful.

### Daily routine

So far a quick overview over business aspects. But there are also many **individual** ones. It starts with your regular morning. This best should be like for a regular office job. You get up early, go into the bath, get dressed, have your breakfast, and start your work. This in detail surely depends on your personal preferences, you've got a lot of freedom. But the regularity helps you to switch into a **work mode**, a separating between spare time and work. And it helps you to focus. Last but not least your colleagues know when they can reach you best.

There are also many ways to arrange your **work area**. It helps a lot if you can chose a quiet area for the most time of your daily work, optimal surely an own room, a home office. But it also works with a different quiet room. Sleeping rooms are quiet over the day too, or a dressing room. If nobody is at home over the day the kitchen table may be also okay, or a litte desk in your living room. And when the virus crises is over a co-working space is a very good alternative too. Here they provide a good infrastructure and you have got other people for daily smalltalk around you.

While I said that you should find a standard time and location this doesn't mean it's **fixed**. Modern working from home means that it's normally no problem to move or interrupt your working times due to visits of doctors, garages, barbers, quickly shopping a bargain, or simply having a break to enjoy the sun. If possible you could work on your veranda too. And it's always nice to meet colleagues in a coffee shop to discuss topics or simply cultivate your contacts, once it's possible again.

Working from home should not lead into **isolation**. Use your possibilities to contact the colleagues and enjoy talking about topics not related to your work. It's like standing with a cup of coffee in the door of the next office room and talk with them about movies, music, or hobbies. Only that it's virtually. **Instant messaging**, **text chats**, and **video calls** help a lot. In case of chatting take care how you're writing in chat. Your colleagues don't get your facial expression or your voice. Once a conversation gets unpleasant ask for a quick video call, it helps. Also typical team meetings, daily or weekly, should be via video. No long time, just exchanging news or the current status of a process. This helps a lot.

All meeting **protocols** and other **documentation** should be maintained online too. Here you can use tools like the Google docs or a wiki. This way the information reaches all people of your team, regardless of location or individual reasons for missing a meeting.

While working our **cat** often sleeps in my office. And from time to time she likes to jump on my lap or the desk, especially when I've got a video call. But that's never a problem, nobody cares. Also when your partner or your child rushes into the room. Quickly excuse yourself, mute the microphone, care for the interruption, and return to the meeting. Remote working people normally are pretty flexible here too.

So only one part left, especially when the virus crisis is over and we can **travel** again. Remote companies should establish **real life meetings** from time to time. Those may be in smaller teams or with the whole company if possible. Even in pure remote companies it is very important to create a better **team spirit**. This is hard to establish via video. In real life people meet from face to face, talk about much more than only work, have fun, enjoy good meals, and drink wine or beer. **Events** together like sightseeing tours can amplify this.

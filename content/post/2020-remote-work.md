Interestingly I already wanted to write about remote work before the current crisis. I had the luck to start with it in 2011. I then began working for [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), a world-wide distributed company. My direct colleagues had been spread from New Zealand and Australia via several locations in Europe to North- and South-America. A fantastic feeling. Actually I'm working for [Loodse](https://www.loodse.com/), not as large but 100% remote too. And I enjoy working with all my different colleagues.

But right now the motivation for many is a different one. It's the virus crisis which forces people to stay home and to work there. Not all jobs allow to do so, but IT jobs like mine or many other typical office jobs do so. So this possibly is a chance to establish remote work even more. So far many executive boards are still sceptical.

Why do I appreciate remote work so much? It's being close to the family, having a self designed office, quiet and in my case with self-chosen hardware. Additionally I'm avoiding the daily commuting. Here I once had an one hour distance, 10 hours lost time per week, not talking about the additional cost. So useless and dumb. And I also like the freedom regarding the time or the working place, will write more about it later. And a special benefit is the feeling. Your team isn't determined by the location. It's determined by the specialisation of the people, their knowledge, their interests. And as mentioned above you may have international colleagues you're working with each day.

### Infrastructure

One interesting topic is the infrastructure. Many companies do have their own data center. So they need enough capacity and the technology to enter it from outside. VPNs and terminal servers are a way. The other one chosen by many IT startups is to use external services like Google Apps. And there's a lot for office, HR and recruiting, sales, customer service, travel booking and cost management, documentation, and communication. And for development teams there's code management, code review, and CI. So you can avoid own central infrastructure.

But still the employees need their hardware. Distribution of central managed computers and mobile phones is one way. Another is supporting people in buying their own computer or using their private ones for the job too. As we all know we have individual preferences. As long as those match to the environment it's no problem.

### Processes

Surely communication is more simple when sitting in one room or you just have to walk around the corner. But there are possibilities. You can establish instant messaging, group chats in channels, or video calls. In case of being spread over multiple countries and time zones you have to take care when setting up meetings. Try to find a convenient time vor all invited colleagues, communicate times including a fixed time zone like UTC, and take care for bank holidays. Sounds difficult but isn't. Just care for it.

Also when having your video group calls, single ones as well as regular ones per day or week, then try to make them short. It's difficult to participate in long video discussions, especially when you're one of the passive members for one topic. So try to first cover the status exchange for all or general discussions and then setup individual calls for smaller groups with need for more discussion.

Another aspect of distribution is the sharing of information. Not all can always exchange in the meetings and calls, follow all chats, or participate in detailed discussions about decisions. So always take notes and document ideas, concepts, and decisions. Here wikis are very simple and useful.

### Daily routine

So far a quick overview over some of the business aspects. But there are also several individual ones. One of it is the daily routine. Sure you've got a lot of freedom when you're working and if you do it in a leisure suit (or even less). But it's better to do it like in a regular office job. Chose your standard wake-up time in the morning, visit the bath, get dressed, have your breakfast, and start your job. Sure it may be different in your case, but at least try to have a standard way to start your day and then get into your work mode. So you can focus and separate spare time and work. Also your colleagues know when they can reach you.

Beside your start the end is important too. Log your time and finish work. It's important for your work-life balance. Otherwise you quickly make too much overtime and loose your energy.

### Workplace

As for the time you've got a lot of freedom to chose your workplace. There's no problem to work on the couch in front of the TV. But you can imagine the problems here. It does not really help to concentrate on your tasks. Best surely is an extra room, your home office. Quite, with convenient furniture and, at least in my case, music. I've also bought a height-adjustable desktop at IKEA. It doesn't cost too much. If you don't have an extra room, then try to find a silent edge. Before my office I've worked in our walk-in closed on a home-made table. Another alternative seen at my colleagues are for example sleeping rooms or little edges in the living room. And when the virus crises is over a co-working space is a very good alternative too. Here they provide a good infrastructure and you have got other people for daily smalltalk around you.

### Freedom

Yes, I've said you should have your standard time and your standard location. But please also enjoy the freedom of working remote. You surely can move or break your working time in case you need it, for example for visiting  doctors, garages, or barbers, the quickly shopping of bargains, or simply to have a break to enjoy the sun. It's so wonderful fuss-free.

And beside several changes in your working time you also can change your working place. In case you've got the opportunity you can work on the veranda. Or you can meet colleagues in a coffee shop to discuss topics or simply cultivate your contacts, once it's possible again.

### Communication

While there are many benefits it important, that working from home does not lead into isolation. Use your possibilities to contact the colleagues and enjoy talking about topics not always related to your work. It's like standing with a cup of coffee in the door of the next office room and talk to them about movies, music, or hobbies. Only that it's virtually and distributed. Instant messaging, text chats, and video calls help a lot.

But In case of messaging or chatting take care how you're writing in chat. You may know it from private chatting and social messaging. The people don't get your facial expression or your voice. So once a conversation gets unpleasant say sorry, try to rephrase it, and ask for a quick video call, it helps. Also typical team meetings, daily or weekly, should be via video. No long time, just exchanging news or the current status of a process. In case of special topics to discuss the concerned participants can continue in an extra call.

All meeting protocols and other results should be maintained online too. Here you can use tools like the Google Docs or similar, or a wiki. This way the information reaches all people of your team, regardless of location, time zone, or individual reasons for missing a meeting.

While I'm working working our cat **Flora** often sleeps in my office on the rack behind me. And from time to time she likes to jump on my lap or the desktop, especially when I've got a video call. But that's never a problem, nobody cares. And it's the same with the partner or children. When they rush into the room it's never a problem. Just a quick sorry, mute the microphone, care for the interruption, and return to the meeting. Remote working people normally are very understandingly here, the know the situation.

### Real life meetings

So only one part left, especially when the virus crisis is over and we can travel again. Remote companies should establish real life meetings from time to time. Those may be in smaller teams or sometimes with the whole company if possible. Even in pure remote companies it is very important to create a better team spirit. This is hard to establish via video. In real life people meet from face to face, talk about much more than only work, have fun, enjoy good meals, and drink wine or beer. Events together like sightseeing tours can amplify this.

There are some of the relative cheap Islay whiskies which are in most collections. Like the Laphroaig 10yo or the Ardbeg TEN. Another interesting one of them, completely without smoke, is the **Bunnahabhain 12yo**.

### Nose

The nose of the Bunnahabhain is strong difference from typical Islay whiskies. It's a fresh and round fragrance, sweet with a hint of sultanas. and cereals. There are also nuts and very little smoke in the background.

### Taste

The taste of the Bunnahabhain is intense with light fruity notes. In addition, the malt contains hints of nuts, some vanilla and malt.

### Finish

The finish is beautifully warm and mild. This lasts for a long time and is pleasant.

A round and mild Islay without much smoke or peat. And this at a reasonable price. So you can add it well to your own collection. I give it **79/100** points.

As a friend of single malt whiskies I'm always happy to participate at tastings. This time I got an invitation by *Darrell*, the organiser of the *Oldenburg English Club*. And on last Thursday *Sandra* and *Ulli* of [Malts4you](https://www.malts4you.com/) conducted it in the [Appeltje](https://www.appeltje-oldenburg.de/), a small and pretty café in the inner city of Oldenburg. They've been very friendly and offered some good finger food.

In the beginning Ulli gave a little introduction into the procedure with the list of whiskies and the tasting cards where the tasted malts—or better there price—is noted. Afterwards he gave an overview over the different whiskies both offered. It has been a nice and special collection of Scottish and other malts, many of them special bottlings. Based on the descriptions and tips of other guests everybody then had the chance to choose. My malts had been

### Oban "The Night's Watch"

- Nose: _Fruity with aromas of orange peel and cherries_
- Taste: _Oak, caramel, some salt and spice_
- Finish: _Caramel and some spice, not too long_
  
### Bladnoch Adela 15yo

- Nose: _Sweet and juicy, also some nuts and coffee_
- Taste: _Chocolate, dried fruit, Peper and sherry_
- Finish: _Sweet and warm_
  
### Knockando 21yo

- Nose: _Sweet, malt and chocolate, some ginger, salt_
- Taste: _Strong with cherry and vanilla, little notes of caramel_
- Finish: _Warm, long, some spice and honey_

### Bruichladdich 13yo Cask Strength 63.7%

- Nose: _Hefty and dirty nose, like silty sand from the coast, also sherry and dark chocolate, some candy; with water also gooseberry_
- Taste: _An explosion on the tip of the tongue, sandpaper on the back of the tongue, vinegar, like warm bitumen long sticking; with water less explosive_
- Finish: _Long and strong, much later again rebelling_

### Tobermory 2008/2018 9yo 65,3%

- Nose: _Pure alcohol, wonderful  ripe fruits like plums and dates; with water some bitumen_
- Taste: _Very  spicy, much salt on the tip on the tongue while a dry Lindt 99% chocolate on the back of the tongue; with water more hazelnut and lighter milk chocolate_
- Finish: _Wonderful long, warm, and spicy_

Especially the Knockando, the Bruichladdich, and the Tobermory had been really good. But for the Bruichladdich you need the right mood, it's quite hefty. My choice of the evening so has been the Tobermory as a wonderful cask strength, even if it is only 9 years young. The next day I ordered one at Sandra and Ulli. Slàinte!

As you know from time to time, I do have the chance to give a talk about an interesting topic. Sometimes it's pretty close to my work, sometimes it's just inspired by my own ideas. In this case it's a mix.

The conference this time had been the **betterCode() API** on 27.04.2022. Here I had the talk *"Let the computer do it - Usage of declarative APIs"*. It describes the troubles of today usual imperative APIs and how to use them in a declarative way. One example is more technological than business, it's about Kubernetes. But the idea can be used for an own infrastructure running business services in a declarative way. Alternatively you could talk Kubernetes as runtime and place your business into operators.

You'll find the slides as usual at [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/TheMue/let-the-computer-do-it).

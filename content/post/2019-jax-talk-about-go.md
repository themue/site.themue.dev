The JAX conference typically focusses on Java technologies, the J of the
name already shows it. But over the last years it opened more and more
for other languages or external infrastructure technologies influencing the
system architecture for solitions.

And so this year in May I had the chance to give an introduction into
Google Go. The slides can be found at SlideShare as usual. But additionally
the organizers recorded the one hour talk on video. It's in German and
can be found at YouTube.

Enjoy it.

Certainly, the **Glenfiddich 21 yo Gran Reserva** is not the first malt one gets to know from this distillery. The 12-year-old is better known, an inexpensive and good entry-level whisky. My first contact with the 21-year-old was at a time when it was still the **Havana Reserve**. A really very good malt. At the time, it was not allowed to be sold in the USA because of its name. Today it is only available as a collector's item. The **Gran Reserva** is its successor.

### Nose

The nose is greeted with sweetness and fruitiness. The **Glenfiddich** seems like a sea of flowers, complemented with some brittle and ginger. There is also a hint of vanilla.

### Taste

On the palate, the malt is intense and spicy. It consists of beautiful honey and antique leather. You can taste the oak of the maturation, rounded off with citrus fruits and at the end again the ginger of the nose.

### Finish

The finish of the **Glenfiddich Gran Reserva** is again spicy. The finish is nice and warm and lasts a long time. It is pleasantly spicy at the end.

The **Glenfiddich 21 yo Gran Reserva** is a good malt. But unfortunately it does not come close to its excellent old predecessor. On the other hand, it is quite affordable despite its age and thus a nice addition to the Speyside malts in a collection. It gets **84/100** points in my ranking.

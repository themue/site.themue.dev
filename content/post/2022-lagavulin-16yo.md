The **Lagavulin 16 yo** is a true classic, well known in almost every whisky collection. And for good reason, because it is a beautiful representative of this important region.

### Nose

It plays around the nose with initial salt and unusual iodine. Peat and smoke are found only a little, but a little cold ashtray. The scent of citrus fruits and flowers round off the nose.

### Taste

At the beginning, the tongue receives a nice round initial sharpness and also the iodine from the nose. They last for a long time. In addition, there is the peat of an Islay. The end is prepared by chocolate, marmalade and nuts, also some sweetness.

### Finish

The finish of the Lagavulin 16yo is very pleasant. It is wonderfully long and deep, and wonderfully warm. At the same time, it remains soft, not scratchy. It's fun and invites you to enjoy it.

The summary is simple, the Lagavulin 16yo is right. It is an Islay, but does not burn your throat. It is intense, contains the right flavours and offers a thrilling journey from the exciting nose to the intense flavour to the round and warm finish. A must for every collection. It scores **90/100** points in my rating.

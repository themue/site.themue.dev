And again, new tasting notes for my single malt collection, today the 
**Glenrothes Halloween Edition 13yo 2019**. After that, more will follow 
at a faster pace, as I'm formulating the keyword notes in my database. 
After that comes another change, but more on that in the conclusion.

### Nose

The nose of the Glenrothes is surprising. As always, it contains 
vanilla and orange, plus floral notes. But the traces of smoke, salt 
and wet oak are exciting. This is not usually found so strongly in 
Glenrothes.

### Taste

With the taste, the surprise takes full effect and it becomes clear 
why this malt is the Halloween Edition. It contains an unusual amount 
of smoke and ash for a Speyside. In addition, this whisky tastes of 
very strong dark chocolate with 99%. Peppery notes and the sweetness 
of dried fruit round off the taste.

### Finish

The finish of the Glenrothes is also almost like an Islay. It is strong, 
very warm and smoky. It can be felt for a long time. But the creamy notes 
are still nice, as one is used to from the regular Glenrothes.

All in all, it is a surprising Glenrothes, its name fits. The friend of 
this distillery can also treat himself to the Halloween Edition, it simply 
fits.

The innovation mentioned above will be the rating. Until now, it was a simple 
score between 0 and 10, but it sometimes seemed too rough to me. So I have 
changed my database - not all the values yet, just the system - and now I 
give the nose, taste, finish and the overall expectation a score between 0 
and 25. The overall score will therefore be between 0 and 100, although it will
probably be the upper third in many cases. In the case of the Glenrothes 
Halloween Edition 13yo 2019, it is **79/100** points.

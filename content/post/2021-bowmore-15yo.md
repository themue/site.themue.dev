Some time ago I already had the **Bowmore No. 1** as a small addition to
a **Bowmore 12yo**. And it was also with this 15-year-old, but as a result
will still find his in my collection. It pleases with its post-maturation
in *Oloroso Sherry* casks and its price is really fair.

### Nose

The Bowmore 15yo pleases the nose with very pleasant salty sea notes, which
make the location of the distillery clear. A nice freshness, plus some smoke
from the houses near the coast are reflected in the aroma. Everything is
rounded off by the beautiful notes of sherry.

### Taste

On the palate, the Bowmore surprises with a nice sweetness on the tip of the
tongue. This continues to be accompanied by smoke and, in this case, a strong
sherry. But the oak of the barrels can also be found. Pungency and spice, on
the other hand, are only slight.

### Finish

Even in the finish, this whisky is wonderfully pleasantly smoky with nice
sherry notes - all nicely fitting. There is also some sweetness as well
as the oak of the cask again. This pleases.

All in all, I liked this single malt, I give it an **71/100** points. And since 
I had just emptied a few bottles again, I now have room in my cupboard again. 
There I strike again at the next opportunity.

## Who am I?

My name is **Frank MÃ¼ller*** a.k.a **Mue*** and I'm located in
*Oldeburg / Germany / Europe / World*. Here I'm also born in 1965 and
decided to stay because it is such a wonderful town.

## What do I do?

In my main profession I'm a software engineer with now more than 30 years
of experience. Additionally since 1999 I'm writing articles in IT magazines
and giving talks on conferences. You'll find more about it in my
[career section](/career/).

## Why the motto?

I once simply discovered how normal change is. And also how helpful it is to
not fight against those everyday changes but to embrance them and transform
them into your advantage.

## Who am I

Hello, my name is *Frank Müller*, known here on the net as _themue_. Friends sometimes call me *mue*. My family and I live here in Oldenburg in the north-west of Germany. Professionally, I have been involved in IT for over 30 years now. And I like programming in private. Additionally I love single malt whiskies. You will find articles on both topics and even more here.

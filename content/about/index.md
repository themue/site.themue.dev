## Who am I

My name is **Frank Müller** a.k.a **TheMue** (or short **Mue**) and I'm located
in *Oldeburg / Germany / Europe / World*. Here I'm also born in 1965 and
decided to stay because it is such a wonderful town.

## What do I do

In my main profession I'm an **Enterprise Architect** with now more than 30 years
of experience. Additionally since 1999 I'm writing articles in IT magazines
and giving talks on conferences. You'll find more about it in my
[career section](/career/).

## Why the motto

I once simply discovered how normal change is. And also how helpful it is to
not fight against those everyday changes but to embrance them and transform
them into your advantage.

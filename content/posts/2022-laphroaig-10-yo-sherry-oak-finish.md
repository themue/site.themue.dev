In addition to the standard malt, Laphroaig also offers special bottlings from time to time. The **Laphroaig 10 yo Sherry Oak Finish** with 48% is such a speciality. After American bourbon casks, it still matures in sherry casks and here still specifically an Oloroso sherry finish.

### Nose

A nice intense aroma hits the nose right off the bat. It contains salt and iodine, but also turpentine. Dark chocolate and wet wood finish.

### Taste

The taste explodes with a lot of pepper. The wet wood of the aroma is continued even more strongly. Notes of seaweed and smoke round out the flavor.

### Finish

In the finish, the Laphroaig spoils beautifully warm and long. It is always pleasant and round. The warmth brought along at the beginning lasts a nice long time even after the sip has already reached its destination.

With this drop, Laphroaig has again succeeded in creating a truly beautiful Islay. He takes with his enjoyment on a beautiful journey. With the Sherry Oak Finish 10 yo, the distillery remains true to its style and has increased its diversity again. In my rating, it receives **83/100** points.

It is 17 March. And what about it? Well, it’s **St. Patrick’s Day** ☘️ again. It’s one of the island’s wonderful traditions, very special, celebrated and with its own culinary delights.

And so I've yesterday prepared myself cooking a big pot of **Irish Stew**. It was left to mature overnight and I treated myself to it today with a delicious **Guinness**. Now I’m rounding off the evening with a fine  **Bushmills 10 yo**.

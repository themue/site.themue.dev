A few weeks have passed since the last entry. Which doesn't mean that I haven't had any malts. The corresponding tasting notes will follow in the coming days. The first one today is the **Glenmorangie Extremely Rare 18 yo**.

### Nose

A pleasant soft and very mild nose with sweet notes of berries and honey. There is also some white chocolate and the mild aroma of caramel. The contrast is provided by light oak notes and the spiciness of ginger. So the aroma is always fun.

### Taste

The vanilla and chocolate are found in the taste. The most important element, however, is the sherry, plus some nut, the tingle of salt and, at the end, the spiciness of pepper. Round, if not exciting.

### Finish

The finish, on the other hand, is again a nice contrast. It is mild like the malt overall, not scratchy and smoky. Instead, it is long lasting and pleasantly warm. This rounds out the enjoyment.

The Glenmorangie Extremely Rare 18 yo is a nice round drop, mild and warm, soft and long lasting. This makes fun and the malt so a good drop for a Sunday evening. In my rating, he receives **83/100** points.

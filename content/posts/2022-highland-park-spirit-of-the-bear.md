In today's Tasting Notes, I'm describing a special single malt. It is the **Highland Park Spirit of the Bear**. But what makes it special for me? It's not the age, the alcohol content or the price. It's much more the place of purchase. It was in a duty free at Munich airport. Otherwise, the malt is not exactly special. Matured in a sherry cask and with 40 % alcohol, it comes without age and is quite cheap.

### Nose

In contrast to many other Highland Parks, the Spirit of the Bear has a very lively flavour. The nose is caressed by berries and a sea of flowers.

### Taste

This malt is also only slightly spicy on the palate. Light notes of salt and nutmeg form the prelude. They pass into nutmeg and end with sweet vanilla notes.

### Finish

The finish of this whisky is only medium long but warm. It is pleasant without being scratchy and pleases with slightly smoky notes.

It's not a special Highland Park, I've had and still have better ones in my collection. But at this price, it's okay.  It scores **61/100** points in my rating.

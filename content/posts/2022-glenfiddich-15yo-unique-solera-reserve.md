Glenfiddich is one of the great and well-known distilleries of Speyside, for many especially the twelve-year-old found in many shops. But the distillery offers many more variants. One is the **Glenfiddich 15 yo Unique Solera Reserve**, a fine drop from the house.

### Nose

The Glenfiddich pleases with a wonderful soft note. Leading the way is a delicious honey, rounded off very lightly by a little banana. Vanilla scents form the background.

### Taste

The taste, on the other hand, starts off more intense. Chilli and pepper immediately spread on the tongue. But they are not alone. After the initial impact, the paray nut and some strong dark chocolate caress the palate. At the end, a hint of oak rounds off the taste.

### Finish

After this wave, a warm and intense finish can now be enjoyed. It lasts long without burning.

The **Glenfiddich 15 yo** is a pleasant and round Speyside, wonderfully intense in nose and mouth, beautifully warm on the finish. Just right for an autumn evening after a sunny day. I gave it **83/100** points.

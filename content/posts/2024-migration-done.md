So, the time has come. There has been a break for a while. Maintaining my own server became too time consuming and so I am currently in the process of moving all my services to a cheaper full service provider. This website is now online. The technology with content in Markdown and rendering via Hugo has remained the same, a great software, easy to use and fast. I also made two or three changes to the theme for the new site and now I can get back to work.

In the meantime, I have of course collected more topics that will be published here in the near future. Some of them are about software development, security and the individual perception of supposed truths in times of fakes and AI.

But rest assured, there will still be tasting notes on my malts, I have already prepared several and just need to finalize them. I will also continue to provide regular updates on my Tideland software. Development here was interrupted for a while due to changes in my job. But now I have resumed development. I hope you will continue to enjoy it.

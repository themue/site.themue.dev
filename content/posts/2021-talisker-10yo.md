My whisky today was the young **Talisker 10 yo**. As a Nordic malt from the Islands, it has its own taste, not comparable to the Speysides but also not like the Islays.  It is a strong and beautiful drop with 45.8%.

### Nose

The aroma of the nose and wonderfully strong. At first it is salty and slightly smoky. Then there is some seawater and even a bit of the aroma of lemon in the background.

### Taste

The taste is sweet but also a little smoky. There was also some barley malt and dry fruits. Last but not least, there was an intense pepper note, but not too much.

### Finish

As it should be, the malt was nice and warming on the finish. It is intense and lingers for a long time. Again, the peppery notes of the flavour are found at the end.

This 10 year old doesn't hold a candle to the 18 year old or even the 25 year old. But it is tasty, balanced and strong. And so it gets **73/100** years points from me.

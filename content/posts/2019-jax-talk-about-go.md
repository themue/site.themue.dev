The **JAX conference** typically focusses on Java technologies, the J of the name already shows it. But over the last years it opened more and more for other languages or external infrastructure technologies influencing the system architecture for solutions.

And so this year in May I had the chance to give an introduction into **Google Go** as an alternative programming language. The slides can be found at [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/TheMue/ein-gopher-im-netz) as usual. But additionally the organizers recorded the one hour talk on video. It's in German and can be found at [YouTube](https://youtu.be/bGL7bylm550).

Enjoy it.

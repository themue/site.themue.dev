Some drops I let stand a little long, this one five years. But I'm glad that with my **The Glenlivet 18 yo** the cork is not dry and the now opened bottle continues to seal well. It will not get much older now, but a good closure is already important.

### Nose

A wonderful aroma reaches the nose on the Glenlivet. Sweet berries start things off, but are then complemented by hearty and fresh moss and leather notes. Then in the background there is nice dark chocolate with at least 90%. And even though it is a Speyside, the aroma contains some peat.

### Taste

On the palate, the Glenlivet 18 yo is delightfully mild and warm. A mix of nuts and vanilla, but also with slight spiciness from ginger and some pepper.

### Finish

Right out of the taste, the malt transitions into a nice warm and lingering finish. It is accompanied by oak and malt.

The Glenlivet 18 yo may not be high end, but it is pleasing, very round and nice, very smooth and also very warm. A pleasant malt for a quiet evening. It achieved **89/100** points in my rating.

      <description>It is 17 March. And what about it? Well, it’s St. Patrick’s Day ☘️ again. It’s one of the island’s wonderful traditions, very special, celebrated and with its own culinary delights.&#xA;And so I&amp;rsquo;ve yesterday prepared myself cooking a big pot of Irish Stew. It was left to mature overnight and I treated myself to it today with a delicious Guinness. Now I’m rounding off the evening with a fine Bushmills 10 yo.</description>

      <description>After a Balblair 27 yo from 1974, I was interested in more special bottlings of these malts. A hunt via eBay then led me to this C&amp;amp;S Dram Senior Balblair 21 yo. Cheap at the time of purchase, now hardly available or only at a premium.&#xA;Nose This particular Belblair welcomes the nose with a very special aroma. It contains intense, partly sour notes of red fruits, orange and strong sherry.</description>

      <description>At 5 years old, Ardbeg Wee Beastie is younger than our good classic Ardbeg TEN. Thus, it is to be expected that he is stronger and wilder than his big brother, the name suggests it. And so it is, though not to the strong degree that the age difference would lead one to expect.&#xA;Nose Initially, intense pepper and sea salt can be perceived. This is then joined by sweet notes of pine resin and the lovely smoke of an open campfire.</description>

      <description>This week in Mainz was JAX 2023 again, organized by Software &amp;amp; Support. It was nice, because slowly the conferences are getting more full, more real again. JAX was also hybrid and the organizers put a lot of effort into streaming all workshops and talks in parallel and connecting visitors at home via chat. But it&amp;rsquo;s not the same as on-site, sharing, discussing, laughing, eating and drinking.&#xA;As I said, the conference consisted of workshops on Monday and Friday, and three days of keynotes, talks and panel discussions from Tuesday through Thursday.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to share with you some news about the new release v0.3.0 of the Tideland Go Actor. This new version comes with a handful of exciting updates and improvements that make it easier and more efficient to work with Actors in Go. One important change in this release is the addition of the Repeat() method. This new feature allows developers to run background Actions in intervals, making it easier to handle long-running tasks in the background.</description>

      <description>The Glenfiddich 21 yo Gran Reserva is certainly not the first malt I have come across from this distillery. More commonly known is the 12-year-old, an affordable and good entry-level whisky. But I have had the opportunity to enjoy a 21-year-old from the house before. This was the legendary Glenfiddich 21 yo Havana Reserve and it was really very good. But it was not allowed to be imported into the USA with that name.</description>

      <description>One of the always very good distilleries is Talisker on the Isle of Skye. They produce malts with and without an age statement. The Talisker 18 yo has a mature age, which welcomes the gourmet with a beautiful golden color and a strong 45.8 %.&#xA;Nose A wonderful aroma welcomes the connoisseur, it cannot deny its origin with sea salt and seaweed. But there are also sweet berries and a light caramel.</description>

      <description>The Dalmore Port Wood Reserve is marketed as No Age without any indication of age. However, there is information from the distillery that it is matured for 14 years in bourbon casks before it is finished for 2 to 3 years in Portuguese port wine casks. This makes it at least 16 years old.&#xA;Nose The Dalmore Port Wood Reserve pleases, as is to be expected with its finish, with fruity and strong notes.</description>

      <description>There are some of the relative cheap Islay whiskies which are in most collections. Like the Laphroaig 10 yo or the Ardbeg TEN. Another interesting one of them, completely without smoke, is the Bunnahabhain 12 yo.&#xA;Nose The nose of the Bunnahabhain is strong difference from typical Islay whiskies. It&amp;rsquo;s a fresh and round fragrance, sweet with a hint of sultanas. and cereals. There are also nuts and very little smoke in the background.</description>

      <description>Glenfiddich is one of the great and well-known distilleries of Speyside, for many especially the twelve-year-old found in many shops. But the distillery offers many more variants. One is the Glenfiddich 15 yo Unique Solera Reserve, a fine drop from the house.&#xA;Nose The Glenfiddich pleases with a wonderful soft note. Leading the way is a delicious honey, rounded off very lightly by a little banana. Vanilla scents form the background.</description>

      <description>In addition to the standard malt, Laphroaig also offers special bottlings from time to time. The Laphroaig 10 yo Sherry Oak Finish with 48% is such a speciality. After American bourbon casks, it still matures in sherry casks and here still specifically an Oloroso sherry finish.&#xA;Nose A nice intense aroma hits the nose right off the bat. It contains salt and iodine, but also turpentine. Dark chocolate and wet wood finish.</description>

      <description>So far I had not missed generics in Go. Much could be solved via interfaces or closures. And with the disgusting syntactic aberrations of other languages when dealing with generics, I was rather afraid that the elegant simplicity of Go could be lost. As of Go 1.18, Google&amp;rsquo;s language now handles generics after much discussion.&#xA;I have always appreciated the implicit simplicity with which, for example, types in a statement like</description>

      <description>The The Balvenie Single Barrel Sherry Cask 15 yo with its 47.8% is a special drop. It is not available in every store, I ordered it in France. This was easy for me, even without a previous tasting, as none of my Balvenies have ever disappointed me so far. So also this time.&#xA;Nose The nose of this malt immediately greets with wonderful notes. There are fruits such as cranberries and beautiful orange.</description>

      <description>A few weeks have passed since the last entry. Which doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any malts. The corresponding tasting notes will follow in the coming days. The first one today is the Glenmorangie Extremely Rare 18 yo.&#xA;Nose A pleasant soft and very mild nose with sweet notes of berries and honey. There is also some white chocolate and the mild aroma of caramel. The contrast is provided by light oak notes and the spiciness of ginger.</description>

      <description>From time to time, the opportunity presents itself for a decision that would not normally be necessary. However, it opens up the possibility of moving in a direction that is both reminiscent of beautiful points in the past, appealing in its environment and brings a nice new challenge. A few months ago this opportunity reached me through a contact over Internet and with the beginning of this month it has become effective.</description>

      <description>As you know, I from time to time have the chance to give a talk about an interesting topic. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s pretty close to my work, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s just inspired by my own ideas. In this case it&amp;rsquo;s a mix.&#xA;The conference this time had been the betterCode() API on 27.04.2022. Here I had the talk &amp;ldquo;Let the computer do it - Usage of declarative APIs&amp;rdquo;. It describes the troubles of today usual imperative APIs and how to use them in a declarative way.</description>

      <description>The Lagavulin 16 yo is a true classic, well known in almost every whisky collection. And for good reason, because it is a beautiful representative of this important region.&#xA;Nose It plays around the nose with initial salt and unusual iodine. Peat and smoke are found only a little, but a little cold ashtray. The scent of citrus fruits and flowers round off the nose.&#xA;Taste At the beginning, the tongue receives a nice round initial sharpness and also the iodine from the nose.</description>

      <description>The package Tideland Go Wait reached v0.2.0 due to a new added feature. It now contains the type Throttle to provide a limited processing of events per second, e.g. for web handlers. The events are simple closures or functions with a given signature. The limit and a burst size for the maximum number of events during one call are defined at throttle creation.&#xA;Example A throttled wrapper of a http.Handler.</description>

      <description>Some drops I let stand a little long, this one five years. But I&amp;rsquo;m glad that with my The Glenlivet 18 yo the cork is not dry and the now opened bottle continues to seal well. It will not get much older now, but a good closure is already important.&#xA;Nose A wonderful aroma reaches the nose on the Glenlivet. Sweet berries start things off, but are then complemented by hearty and fresh moss and leather notes.</description>

      <description>There are times when you find a bug in your software. Today it had been in my testing library TIdeland Go Audit. Here the assertion ErrorContains() reacted with a panic in case of a nil error. So I fixed it like I already had done it earlier in ErrorMatch(). Interestingly I found in testing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t verified it there. So this test is now changed too.&#xA;Additionally during tests for a different library with high concurrency I, or better go test during the tests, discovered a race condition.</description>

      <description>A drop that had to wait almost three years for me to open it. But now there has been an event that I wanted to reward myself for. So I looked for my The GlenDronach Parliament 21 yo from my stash and allowed this old Highland speciality with 48% to find its way into my nosing glass.&#xA;Nose A really nice and intense blend, of plums and sultanas, of light walnut notes, violets and spices.</description>

      <description>The Glenmorangie 14 yo Quinta Ruban is a beautiful variant of the Glenmorangie. Aged longer than typical 10 or 12 year olds, matured in ex-bourbon casks with a finish in Ruby Port Pipes. The result is an affordable Highland malt with 46%.&#xA;Nose The Quinta Ruban caresses the nose with a scent of beautiful dark and strong oranges and chocolate. There is damp wood in the background. Scents of exotic spices and flowers complete the beautiful picture.</description>

      <description>You may know my preferences for cask strength whiskies in general as well as whiskies by Highland Park. And so the Highland Park Cask Strength Release No. 1 is a very special whisky for me. I bought it last year and today I opened it today. It has 63,3% alcohol and is very well balanced. I like it.&#xA;Nose What an intense aroma, given by the high alcohol content. It immediately rises to the nose and is accompanied by fresh and fruity notes.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m talking about a rather young malt in my collection. However, the &amp;ldquo;young&amp;rdquo; does not refer to its age, which is 15 years. But I bought it only last month. Today it&amp;rsquo;s about the Glenlivet 15 yo French Oak Reserve. It was allowed to mature in French Limousin oak casks from the Dordogne and is one of the cheapest on the market.&#xA;Nose This is a pleasant and strong aroma, dominated by the beautiful scent of cedar wood.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s Tasting Notes, I&amp;rsquo;m describing a special single malt. It is the Highland Park Spirit of the Bear. But what makes it special for me? It&amp;rsquo;s not the age, the alcohol content or the price. It&amp;rsquo;s much more the place of purchase. It was in a duty free at Munich airport. Otherwise, the malt is not exactly special. Matured in a sherry cask and with 40 % alcohol, it comes without age and is quite cheap.</description>

      <description>Sometimes there is something special. This Christmas it was the Bruichladdich Port Charlotte PC10 Tro Na Linntean, which I got as a birthday present from my family last year. It&amp;rsquo;s a 10-year-old Islay at 59.8%. the peat content is 40ppm. This Christmas I finally opened it.&#xA;Nose A very nice and strong aroma of lemon, barley malt, nuts, oak and maritime notes. Further in the background pineapple, honeydew melon and some peppermint.</description>

      <description>The next malt, which I have had open for a long time, but have now systematically tasted again, is the Ardbeg An Oa. It is a little sweeter than the well-known Ardbeg TEN, as it is matured in PX sherry casks and new oak casks in addition to the bourbon casks. The blend at the end is already special. It has 46.6 %.&#xA;Nose The nose of Ardbeg An Oa is greeted by damp wood and various fruity notes.</description>

      <description>And again, new tasting notes for my single malt collection, today the Glenrothes Halloween Edition 13 yo 2019. After that, more will follow at a faster pace, as I&amp;rsquo;m formulating the keyword notes in my database. After that comes another change, but more on that in the conclusion.&#xA;Nose The nose of the Glenrothes is surprising. As always, it contains vanilla and orange, plus floral notes. But the traces of smoke, salt and wet oak are exciting.</description>

      <description>My whisky today was the young Talisker 10 yo. As a Nordic malt from the Islands, it has its own taste, not comparable to the Speysides but also not like the Islays. It is a strong and beautiful drop with 45.8%.&#xA;Nose The aroma of the nose and wonderfully strong. At first it is salty and slightly smoky. Then there is some seawater and even a bit of the aroma of lemon in the background.</description>

      <description>Some time ago I already had the Bowmore No. 1 as a small addition to a Bowmore 12 yo. And it was also with this 15-year-old, but as a result will still find his in my collection. It pleases with its post-maturation in Oloroso Sherry casks and its price is really fair.&#xA;Nose The Bowmore 15 yo pleases the nose with very pleasant salty sea notes, which make the location of the distillery clear.</description>

      <description>A malt that is already in my collection since February 2019 and was opened only now, is the Glengoyne 18 yo matured in sherry casks. I bought it blind on sale at the time, but I already knew the 15yo. Now I was pleasantly surprised by this wonderful natural colored Highland.&#xA;Nose Your nose immediately will notice its sherry, a fruity mix of dark fruits, sort of like blood oranges or raisins.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the Bowmore No. 1 in a big bottle, but only as a small 50 ml addition to the Bowmore 12 yo. A good size for tasting unknown drops. So is this simple malt, matured only in first fill bourbon casks.&#xA;Nose The Bowmore surprises with its very light aroma for an Islay. It is almost sweet, with notes of vanilla. There is also a damp, slightly earthy spring meadow.</description>

      <description>With the opening of the current bottle, I have decided to publish my tasting notes for each newly opened bottle. As background for you the info that as a long time single malt friend I always have about 50 bottles at home. These come from different regions, so I can always choose nicely. On the one hand I have about 35 closed bottles in the cupboard, on the other hand up to 15 open bottles in a nice box.</description>

      <description>As described a few days ago, I am migrating individual packages of the Tideland libraries to own repositories. I’ve described my motivation for this before. In the meantime, two more packages have been migrated to the main level: Tideland Go Actor and Tideland Go Wait.&#xA;The package Tideland Go Actor pursues the idea to realize concurrency in Go not only via CSP, but with the Actor Model. It picks up the concept of the Erlang/OTP module gen_server.</description>

      <description>A look at the Tideland Go repositories shows that these today are libraries for individual topics with various packages included. One problem with this form of organization is that these packages are difficult to find. At the same time, their individual histories and their versions are tied to those of the entire library. This must be improved.&#xA;Therefore, the reconstruction of these projects has now begun. The packages from the repositories move to the main level and become independent projects.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before that I&amp;rsquo;m currently reorganize my Tideland Go Libraries - once again. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for it and it will be interesting just for those who want to participate in development. The import into your own projects will stay the same.&#xA;This time it&amp;rsquo;s about the Tideland Go Audit library, I&amp;rsquo;ve just released the new v0.5.0. It&amp;rsquo;s a well approved and robust library containing helpful packages for testing. So the update only contains a few changes.</description>

      <description>The Facebook corporation was a thorn in my side early on with its handling of personal data for advertising purposes. On top of that, Facebook itself showed me how difficult it is to keep conversations in check. That&amp;rsquo;s why I deleted my Facebook account a while ago. It was the same with Instagram as another service of the Facebook group.&#xA;As a messenger, I have been using WhatsApp for a long time.</description>

      <description>Interestingly I already wanted to write about working from home already before the current crisis. I had the luck to start with it in 2011. I then began working for Canonical, a world-wide distributed company. My direct colleagues had been spread from New Zealand and Australia via several locations in Europe to North- and South-America. A fantastic feeling. Actually I&amp;rsquo;m working for Loodse, not as large but 100% remote too. And I enjoy working with all my different colleagues.</description>

      <description>In January 21 to 23, 2020 are the next GoDays in Berlin, Germany. And I hope it will be a great conference for all Gophers again like it has been this year too.&#xA;While being a passive visitor last time I&amp;rsquo;ll be active with two slots this time:&#xA;First one will be a workshop from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on 21st together with Nico Schieder and Indradhanush Gupta. We&amp;rsquo;ll introduce you in Kubernetes as platform for own components, because it can do more than deploy and manage containers.</description>

      <description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re celebrating the birthday of our little gopher, Googles programming language Go turns 10. A decade of growing and getting better every year without breaking the promise of source code compatibility. So the community grew to about two million developers world wide and we can find a pretty large number of projects developed in Go. Especially many projects of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation are using Go for implementation, like Docker and Kubernetes, Etcd and Prometheus.</description>

      <description>The JAX conference typically focusses on Java technologies, the J of the name already shows it. But over the last years it opened more and more for other languages or external infrastructure technologies influencing the system architecture for solutions.&#xA;And so this year in May I had the chance to give an introduction into Google Go as an alternative programming language. The slides can be found at SlideShare as usual. But additionally the organizers recorded the one hour talk on video.</description>

      <description>What shall be special when working with functions? They are part of software development almost since beginning, there&amp;rsquo;s even the paradigm of functional programming. So what&amp;rsquo;s special with functions in Go? Simple answer: nothing. But true to the motto of the language the work with functions and their relatives, the methods, is very pragmatic. And so they get parts of elegant solutions.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with quite simple functions. They can be small, having none, one, more or a variable number of parameters.</description>

      <description>Pretty often you read questions about multiplexing in Go web application on Slack, StackOverflow, or Reddit. Sometimes they think about using libraries like gorilla/mux, which is a powerful software, and its alternatives. Depending on individual requirements and constraints these may make sense, but for many cases the standard library or own little packages based on the standard library are more than enough. I&amp;rsquo;ll show the idea behind the Go net/http package and how to build own solutions based on it.</description>

      <description>As a friend of single malt whiskies I&amp;rsquo;m always happy to participate at tastings. This time I got an invitation by Darrell, the organiser of the Oldenburg English Club. And on last Thursday Sandra and Ulli of Malts4you conducted it in the Appeltje, a small and pretty café in the inner city of Oldenburg. They&amp;rsquo;ve been very friendly and offered some good finger food.&#xA;In the beginning Ulli gave a little introduction into the procedure with the list of whiskies and the tasting cards where the tasted malts—or better there price—is noted.</description>

      <description>On Feb 28th the top level domain .dev has been available for all. So for me as a developer it&amp;rsquo;s the best possible TLD to get. One day later I reserved two different ones:&#xA;themue.dev as a replacement for my former personal domain themue.name and tideland.dev as a replacement of all my different Tideland domains into one. The personal domain is now changed, the Tideland domains will follow these days. Then I also have to change the new Go mono repository I&amp;rsquo;m migrating my packages to.</description>

      <description>Those who visited my blog before will recognize that I deleted several – most – of my old blog entries. The reason has been my disaffection with the way I&amp;rsquo;ve done it before. The mix of the content and the long gaps between two entries did not feel good and attractive. So I had to think about how to change it, what my topics shall be.&#xA;I found two major topics.</description>

      <description>These days it happened again. This time it has been Twitter which changed the services it provides and forced external applications to change due to changes of the API. So it more and more follows Facebook to become a propriatary system, closed and best without any external client. But there are definitely better clients than the original one, in my case it&amp;rsquo;s Tweetbot.&#xA;This change made me thinking about all those closed systems today.</description>

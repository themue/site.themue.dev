      <description>There are times when you find a bug in your software. Today it had been in my testing library TIdeland Go Audit. Here the assertion ErrorContains() reacted with a panic in case of a nil error. So I fixed it like I already had done it earlier in ErrorMatch(). Interestingly I found in testing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t verified it there. So this test is now changed too.&#xA;Additionally during tests for a different library with high concurrency I, or better go test during the tests, discovered a race condition.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before that I&amp;rsquo;m currently reorganize my Tideland Go Libraries - once again. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for it and it will be interesting just for those who want to participate in development. The import into your own projects will stay the same.&#xA;This time it&amp;rsquo;s about the Tideland Go Audit library, I&amp;rsquo;ve just released the new v0.5.0. It&amp;rsquo;s a well approved and robust library containing helpful packages for testing. So the update only contains a few changes.</description>

      <description>At 5 years old, Ardbeg Wee Beastie is younger than our good classic Ardbeg TEN. Thus, it is to be expected that he is stronger and wilder than his big brother, the name suggests it. And so it is, though not to the strong degree that the age difference would lead one to expect.&#xA;Nose Initially, intense pepper and sea salt can be perceived. This is then joined by sweet notes of pine resin and the lovely smoke of an open campfire.</description>

      <description>There are some of the relative cheap Islay whiskies which are in most collections. Like the Laphroaig 10 yo or the Ardbeg TEN. Another interesting one of them, completely without smoke, is the Bunnahabhain 12 yo.&#xA;Nose The nose of the Bunnahabhain is strong difference from typical Islay whiskies. It&amp;rsquo;s a fresh and round fragrance, sweet with a hint of sultanas. and cereals. There are also nuts and very little smoke in the background.</description>

      <title>Laphroaig 10 yo Sherry Oak Finish</title>

      <description>In addition to the standard malt, Laphroaig also offers special bottlings from time to time. The Laphroaig 10 yo Sherry Oak Finish with 48% is such a speciality. After American bourbon casks, it still matures in sherry casks and here still specifically an Oloroso sherry finish.&#xA;Nose A nice intense aroma hits the nose right off the bat. It contains salt and iodine, but also turpentine. Dark chocolate and wet wood finish.</description>

      <description>The Lagavulin 16 yo is a true classic, well known in almost every whisky collection. And for good reason, because it is a beautiful representative of this important region.&#xA;Nose It plays around the nose with initial salt and unusual iodine. Peat and smoke are found only a little, but a little cold ashtray. The scent of citrus fruits and flowers round off the nose.&#xA;Taste At the beginning, the tongue receives a nice round initial sharpness and also the iodine from the nose.</description>

      <description>Sometimes there is something special. This Christmas it was the Bruichladdich Port Charlotte PC10 Tro Na Linntean, which I got as a birthday present from my family last year. It&amp;rsquo;s a 10-year-old Islay at 59.8%. the peat content is 40ppm. This Christmas I finally opened it.&#xA;Nose A very nice and strong aroma of lemon, barley malt, nuts, oak and maritime notes. Further in the background pineapple, honeydew melon and some peppermint.</description>

      <description>The next malt, which I have had open for a long time, but have now systematically tasted again, is the Ardbeg An Oa. It is a little sweeter than the well-known Ardbeg TEN, as it is matured in PX sherry casks and new oak casks in addition to the bourbon casks. The blend at the end is already special. It has 46.6 %.&#xA;Nose The nose of Ardbeg An Oa is greeted by damp wood and various fruity notes.</description>

      <description>Some time ago I already had the Bowmore No. 1 as a small addition to a Bowmore 12 yo. And it was also with this 15-year-old, but as a result will still find his in my collection. It pleases with its post-maturation in Oloroso Sherry casks and its price is really fair.&#xA;Nose The Bowmore 15 yo pleases the nose with very pleasant salty sea notes, which make the location of the distillery clear.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the Bowmore No. 1 in a big bottle, but only as a small 50 ml addition to the Bowmore 12 yo. A good size for tasting unknown drops. So is this simple malt, matured only in first fill bourbon casks.&#xA;Nose The Bowmore surprises with its very light aroma for an Islay. It is almost sweet, with notes of vanilla. There is also a damp, slightly earthy spring meadow.</description>

      <description>With the opening of the current bottle, I have decided to publish my tasting notes for each newly opened bottle. As background for you the info that as a long time single malt friend I always have about 50 bottles at home. These come from different regions, so I can always choose nicely. On the one hand I have about 35 closed bottles in the cupboard, on the other hand up to 15 open bottles in a nice box.</description>

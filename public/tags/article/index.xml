      <description>As you know, I from time to time have the chance to give a talk about an interesting topic. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s pretty close to my work, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s just inspired by my own ideas. In this case it&amp;rsquo;s a mix.&#xA;The conference this time had been the betterCode() API on 27.04.2022. Here I had the talk &amp;ldquo;Let the computer do it - Usage of declarative APIs&amp;rdquo;. It describes the troubles of today usual imperative APIs and how to use them in a declarative way.</description>

      <description>In January 21 to 23, 2020 are the next GoDays in Berlin, Germany. And I hope it will be a great conference for all Gophers again like it has been this year too.&#xA;While being a passive visitor last time I&amp;rsquo;ll be active with two slots this time:&#xA;First one will be a workshop from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on 21st together with Nico Schieder and Indradhanush Gupta. We&amp;rsquo;ll introduce you in Kubernetes as platform for own components, because it can do more than deploy and manage containers.</description>

      <description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re celebrating the birthday of our little gopher, Googles programming language Go turns 10. A decade of growing and getting better every year without breaking the promise of source code compatibility. So the community grew to about two million developers world wide and we can find a pretty large number of projects developed in Go. Especially many projects of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation are using Go for implementation, like Docker and Kubernetes, Etcd and Prometheus.</description>

      <description>These days it happened again. This time it has been Twitter which changed the services it provides and forced external applications to change due to changes of the API. So it more and more follows Facebook to become a propriatary system, closed and best without any external client. But there are definitely better clients than the original one, in my case it&amp;rsquo;s Tweetbot.&#xA;This change made me thinking about all those closed systems today.</description>

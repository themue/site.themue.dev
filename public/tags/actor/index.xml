      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to share with you some news about the new release v0.3.0 of the Tideland Go Actor. This new version comes with a handful of exciting updates and improvements that make it easier and more efficient to work with Actors in Go. One important change in this release is the addition of the Repeat() method. This new feature allows developers to run background Actions in intervals, making it easier to handle long-running tasks in the background.</description>

      <description>As described a few days ago, I am migrating individual packages of the Tideland libraries to own repositories. Iâ€™ve described my motivation for this before. In the meantime, two more packages have been migrated to the main level: Tideland Go Actor and Tideland Go Wait.&#xA;The package Tideland Go Actor pursues the idea to realize concurrency in Go not only via CSP, but with the Actor Model. It picks up the concept of the Erlang/OTP module gen_server.</description>

      <description>As you know, I from time to time have the chance to give a talk about an interesting topic. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s pretty close to my work, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s just inspired by my own ideas. In this case it&amp;rsquo;s a mix.&#xA;The conference this time had been the betterCode() API on 27.04.2022. Here I had the talk &amp;ldquo;Let the computer do it - Usage of declarative APIs&amp;rdquo;. It describes the troubles of today usual imperative APIs and how to use them in a declarative way.</description>

      <description>In January 21 to 23, 2020 are the next GoDays in Berlin, Germany. And I hope it will be a great conference for all Gophers again like it has been this year too.&#xA;While being a passive visitor last time I&amp;rsquo;ll be active with two slots this time:&#xA;First one will be a workshop from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on 21st together with Nico Schieder and Indradhanush Gupta. We&amp;rsquo;ll introduce you in Kubernetes as platform for own components, because it can do more than deploy and manage containers.</description>

      <description>The JAX conference typically focusses on Java technologies, the J of the name already shows it. But over the last years it opened more and more for other languages or external infrastructure technologies influencing the system architecture for solutions.&#xA;And so this year in May I had the chance to give an introduction into Google Go as an alternative programming language. The slides can be found at SlideShare as usual. But additionally the organizers recorded the one hour talk on video.</description>

      <description>This week in Mainz was JAX 2023 again, organized by Software &amp;amp; Support. It was nice, because slowly the conferences are getting more full, more real again. JAX was also hybrid and the organizers put a lot of effort into streaming all workshops and talks in parallel and connecting visitors at home via chat. But it&amp;rsquo;s not the same as on-site, sharing, discussing, laughing, eating and drinking.&#xA;As I said, the conference consisted of workshops on Monday and Friday, and three days of keynotes, talks and panel discussions from Tuesday through Thursday.</description>

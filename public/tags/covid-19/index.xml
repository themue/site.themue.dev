      <description>Interestingly I already wanted to write about working from home already before the current crisis. I had the luck to start with it in 2011. I then began working for Canonical, a world-wide distributed company. My direct colleagues had been spread from New Zealand and Australia via several locations in Europe to North- and South-America. A fantastic feeling. Actually I&amp;rsquo;m working for Loodse, not as large but 100% remote too. And I enjoy working with all my different colleagues.</description>
